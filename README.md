# CitizenStats

Star Citizen bot for sharing stats online, or through a Discord bot (COMING SOON).

This works by "tailing" (watching updates to) the game log, and aggregating the relevant logs within a database that can be queried by the Discord bot and website.

## Features

**Track granular player stats:**

Simple stats like number of kills with a specific ship, to complex chains like how many times you soft-deathed a ship, boarded it, and killed them with FPS weapons, to total rundowns of Org battles.

**Install the Discord bot (coming soon):**

Have a Discord server for your Org? Install the CitizenStats Discord bot (coming soon) and have Org-wide leaderboards right in your Discord server.

**Real-time kill feed (coming soon):**

Have your Org's kills (ship and FPS) show up right in a dedicated Discord channel, including information about Org membership (e.g. show what Org your beating :D)

**Share your stats online (coming soon):**

Choose to share your (and your Org's) stats on the official CitizenStats website.

## Installing

You can install by either:

1. Downloading the latest release on the right side
2. Cloning this code repository and compiling yourself

NEVER install this log collector via ANY OTHER MEANS. We will never distribute the executable another way, and it would be insecure to do so.
