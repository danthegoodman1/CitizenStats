We store log information from the game, and some identifiers (e.g. your IP) for abuse prevention and analysis (e.g. rate limiting).

At any time you may request your data be deleted, and we will do so within 30 days after confirming your ownership of the account.

We only collect the logs that are relevant for current leaderboards. Currently that includes:

- Actor death
- Vehicle destruction
- Corpse
- AccountLoginCharacterStatus_Character (to verify the user)
